# Motivation

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with modern data engineering tools like Python, Docker, Airflow, and PostgreSQL by building a fully functional ELT pipeline.

To make the pipeline robust and production-ready:

Data quality testing is implemented with Soda.

Integration testing is done using Pytest.

The pipeline is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Airflow.

Data visualization and KPIs are added using Power BI.
